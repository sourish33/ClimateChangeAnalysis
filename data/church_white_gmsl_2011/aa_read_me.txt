
This readme file corresponds to GMSL time series in this zipfile 
(church_white_gmsl_2011.zip)

This is our most recent (as of February 2011) update to our GMSL time
series.

The paper describing this update should be published in Surveys in 
Geophysics in 2011. 

See http://www.cmar.csiro.au/sealevel/sl_data_cmar.html for more information
as it becomes available.

We also hope to have a preprint of the paper available on our web site in the
near future.



Monthly and yearly time series are provided in text (.txt) format and also .csv 
format, which should open up easily into spreadsheet programs such as Microsoft 
Excel.

The reconstructed time series are zeroed at 1990. The satellite altimeter 
time series match the reconstructed time series over 1993. This way of 
matching the time series is a choice that we have made - there may be a more 
appropriate way of doing this for your application.



Files are:

CSIRO_Recons_gmsl_mo_2011.txt & .csv    Reconstruction, 1880 to 2009, monthly
CSIRO_Recons_gmsl_yr_2011.txt & .csv    Reconstruction, 1880 to 2009, yearly
CSIRO_ALT_gmsl_mo_2011.txt & .csv       Satellite altimeter data, 1993 to 2009, monthly
CSIRO_ALT_gmsl_yr_2011.txt & .csv       Satellite altimeter data, 1993 to 2009, yearly

 
The 'Recons' files have three columns:

Column 1: time
Column 2: GMSL in millimetres
Column 3: one standard deviation uncertainty in millimetres.

The 'ALT' files have two columns:

Column 1: time
Column 2: GMSL in millimetres

We normally use ~5mm for the uncertainty for this data.


Time formats are:

  Monthly files: 1880.0417 = Jan 1880
                 1880.1250 = Feb 1880
                     .
                     .
                 1880.9583 = Dec 1880
                    etc 

  Yearly files:  1880.5 = yearly average for calendar year 1880
                 1881.5 = yearly average for calendar year 1881
                   etc
